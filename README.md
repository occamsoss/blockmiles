# blockmiles

### Things we need:
1. Register everyone's <insert airline here> miles into a blockchain
2. Establish automated mechanism to pair someone that's willing to purchase miles with someone that has that number of miles available
3. Create a framework for each transaction with the following requirements:
- Person B (buying miles) sends their personal information (name, address, etc.), their payment information, and the ticket they want
- Person A (selling miles) books the ticket for Person B using Person B's personal and payment information
- Person A takes the market value (determined through the app) of the ticket from Person B's payment information
4. Front-end interface for this app (React?)
